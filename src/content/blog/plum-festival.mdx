There is a garden in Mito where three thousand plum trees bloom every February. They have been blooming there since 1842. The garden is called Kairakuen --- *a park to be enjoyed together* --- and for a few weeks each year the city gathers beneath the branches to do exactly that.

This is not a spectacle. Nobody rushes. The blossoms are small, pale, and close to the bark. You have to slow down to see them. You have to get close.

What strikes me about Japanese culture is how seriously it takes the quiet things. A plum tree flowers and an entire festival appears around it --- not to celebrate anything loud, but to hold space for something that will be gone in two weeks. There are lanterns strung between the branches. There are food stalls with steam rising into the cold air. There is the sound of a taiko drum somewhere behind the trees, not performing for an audience, just part of the weather.

The steam from a pork bun steamer catches the warm light of a paper lantern. A child points at a branch. An old couple walks slowly along a gravel path, not talking, not needing to. The blossoms don't care that you came. They were going to bloom anyway. That's what makes it feel sacred.

I think about this a lot --- the way Japan builds ritual around impermanence. Cherry blossoms get all the fame, but the plum festival is quieter, earlier, colder. The flowers bloom while it's still winter. You wear your heavy coat. Your breath is visible. The beauty feels earned.

There's a word, *shun* (旬), that means the peak season of a thing --- the ten days when a fruit is at its most perfect, when a fish is at its fattest, when a flower is at its most open. Japanese food culture orbits around this idea. You eat what the season offers, not because of scarcity, but because attention to timing is a form of respect.

The plum festival is *shun* applied to community. You show up because the trees are ready. Not before, not after. The gathering is shaped by the season, not the other way around.

We build tools that compile intent into code at the speed of thought. We orchestrate agents, parallelize work, compress what used to take weeks into minutes. And this is genuinely good. I don't want to romanticize slowness for its own sake.

But I notice that the things that actually make me happy are almost never fast. They are the passing of seasons. The gathering of people around something small and temporary. The walk to the food stall. The steam. The light.

The plum trees in Kairakuen don't optimize. They bloom on time, every year, for almost two hundred years. The people come, the lanterns go up, the buns steam. Then the petals fall and everyone goes home.

There's nothing to ship. Nothing to deploy. Just a garden, doing what gardens do, and a community that knows how to pay attention.
