### Celebrating beautiful failures

How much beautiful data never sees the light of day because the experiment that produced it was considered a failure? Or maybe it simply didn't fit the narrative for the publication or did not align with the goals of the research lab. It is well known that the majority of scientific endeavours do not work out in the way researchers expect, especially in experimental disciplines.

The exhibition **Fault Tolerance** explores artistic outlets that use data from failed experiments in three fields: Quantum Computing, Computational Biology and Developmental Biology. These three fields span examples of failures across hardware, software and wetware.

Can a collaboration between science and art provide meaningful output, encourage playful exploration and assist the mental health of scientists? This exhibition is a work-in-progress and a collaboration between Grisha Szep, <a href="https://matildaperuzzo.github.io/">Matilda Peruzzo</a> and <a href="https://x.com/slv_caballero">Silvia Caballero</a>
